Summary
I have extensive experience(+17years) in web engineering and development.
I’m always looking to improve my skills, stay on top of the latest trends and learn new technologies.
I am 35 years old, I’m married and have a 7 years boy and girl twins. I love music, i’m a big fan of motorcycles and there's nothing that helps me unwind more than spending a day fishing.
